    Barangay Information System is a system with database in order to monitor the barangay area, including census, barangay population, residence profiling, managing barangay household information, barangay issue, residence work, barangay officials, barangay workers and religion.
    
    The barangay of Oroquieta City, due to its condition of using the manual-based process, the students of University of Science and Information Technology of Southern Philippines (USTP) happen to develop a barangay information system to provide an efficient and effective way to record, report an issue and manage information of the residence in the barangay.
    
    The barangay of Oroquieta City, until now, is using manual system. The barangay usually keep their data hand-written on paper, and file it in a folder. Then the Secretary in the barangay will generate the list of all the names of an individual in a household in each purok, in hand-written again. In tracing the records, the Secretary will find it one by one and it takes a lot of time. These records are very important for different purposes, it should be stored securely.
    
    The 3rd year students of BSIT observed the problem of Oroquieta City. As a result the students create a system that will aid the difficulties in the barangay. The aid system will reduce the hard and longtime procedure of accessing file, and it will be effective in maintaining create, read, update, and deleting records (CRUD) and generating reports of the residence in all barangay in Oroquieta City
